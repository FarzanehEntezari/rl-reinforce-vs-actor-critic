# Reinforcement Learning reinforce-vs-actor-critic

Implementing REINFORCE algorithm with two layered MLP.

Implementing Actor-critic method. Using critic network along with the policy network to learn the optimal behaviour. In critic network, the value function is
learnt through bootstrapping.

Comparing the actor-critic performance against REINFORCE for the cartpole balance (Open AI gym environment) problem.
